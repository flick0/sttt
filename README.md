## Transitions

> ill add a few gifs here soon, the names also might change later on

+ ScanLine

+ Grow

+ Shrink

+ GrowExit

+ ShrinkExit

## Why?

this was supposed to be a tiny little script that does only one linear transition for a [rice im working on](https://github.com/flick0/dotfiles) which ended up taking more of my time than i intended, the idea was partly inspired by [unimatrix](https://github.com/will8211/unimatrix)(the `-w` flag to be precise, which suggests you to put it in .bashrc to run when terminal launches)

## [SWWW](https://github.com/Horus645/swww)?

if the name isnt clear enough( *"swww"* and *"sttt"* ) most of the inspiration comes from swww, the way transitions are made is also pretty similar 
to how swww does it, if somehow you havent heard of swww before, [do go check it out](https://github.com/Horus645/swww), its a wayland wallpaper daemon with fancy transitions

## Thanks!

+ to [bezier-easing](https://github.com/gre/bezier-easing) which i directly translated to python because apparently there are no good cubic bezier easing libs i could find for python
